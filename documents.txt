DocuMind Enterprise is an internal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system.
It is designed to allow users to query enterprise documents using natural language.
The system uses FAISS for vector search and a transformer-based embedding model.
The backend is built using FastAPI and Docker for deployment.
