DocuMind Enterprise RAG
DocuMind Enterprise is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built for enterprise use cases.
It ingests internal documents, retrieves relevant context using semantic search, and generates strictly grounded answers without hallucination.
This project was developed as part of Infotact Solutions – AI Research & Development Wing under the Enterprise Knowledge – RAG-Based SOP Assistant assignment.
